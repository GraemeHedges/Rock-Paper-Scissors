    //Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function
    //called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or 
    //‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.

    //Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The
    //function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and
    //computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of
    //the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
