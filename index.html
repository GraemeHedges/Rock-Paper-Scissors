    //Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function
    //called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or 
    //‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.

    //Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The
    //function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and
    //computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of
    //the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

       let choice =  Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
       if (choice === 0) {

        // playerSelection gives us the players choice (new function?)
        // make the players choice case insensative
        // compare the players choice to the computer selection using the normal logic
        // return a win or lose message depending on result via console.log()
